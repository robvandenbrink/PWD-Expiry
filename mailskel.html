<b>Alert - your password will expire in XXX days.</b></p>

It is important that you change your password as soon as possible to ensure that you do not
lose your access</p>

You can change your password by visiting this link: <a href="https://pwdchg.yourcompany.com">https://pwdchg.yourcompany.com</a>  (you will need your second factor token for this process)</p>

For password policies, please refer to the intranet link here:</p>
<a href="https://intranet.yourcompany.com/somelinkyouwillnotclickorread.html">https://intranet.yourcompany.com/somelinkyouwillnotclickorread.html</a>

The gist of this policy is please choose a long-ish password - longer than 15 characters 
if at all possible.  A phrase works great for this</p>

Things to NOT put in your password:</p>
<ul>
<li>the month</li>
<li>the season</li>
<li>the year</li>
<li>names of relatives or pets</li>
<li>the make or model of your car</li>
<li>your street address or phone number</li>
<li>the name of our company</li>
</ul>

</p>In short, we're hoping that you choose a password that won't be too <span class=GramE>easy, or sitting for all to see on your Facebook or LinkedIn Page.</p>

Please also do not use your corporate password for other sites. For instance, if the pizza place down the
street gets compromised, we don't want your password <b>there</b> leading to a compromise <b>here</b></p></p>
We do appreciate this extra effort on your part.  As a trade-off for these longer passwords, we've changed our password
change interval from 30 days to just 4 times per year.</p>
Thanks again for your help in keeping us secure!</p>
If you need a hand with changing your password, by all means call the helpdesk at 111-222-3333
